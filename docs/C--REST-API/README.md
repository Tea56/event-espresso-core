### RPC Style Endpoints

There are a few endpoints in the EE4 REST API that really don't follow the REST way of doing things, and are more like RPC (Remote Procedure Calls). These endpoints aren't just for simple reading, inserting, updating, or deleting. They have a bunch of other logic tied in there, which can sometimes be handy, so that your application doesn't need to implement all this logic itself (of course if you don't want all this extra logic, you're welcome to use the more traditional RESTy read and writing endpoints instead).

### Libraries

There are some handy libraries that have been built that integrate with the REST API.

| Library | Description |
|---------|-------------|
[eejs-api (VUE.js library)](rest-api-vue-library.md) | When implemented you can use this to automatically build EE model and collection components that can be used in your views.

#### Library Examples/Tutorials
| Example/Tutorial | Library | Description |
|----------------- | ------- | ----------- |
[Simple List of Events with Datetimes](rest-api-vue-library-basic-implementation-example.md) | [eejs-api](rest-api-vue-library.md) | This gives a very basic example of how one can use the eejs-api library to retrieve and display a list of events with their datetimes.
